# Bank Customer Churn Prediction 
## Objective
Based on bank data, identify a customer who might leave.

## Description
Customers have started leaving the bank. Every month. Not a lot, but it's noticeable. Bank marketers have calculated that retaining existing customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones. The task is to forecast whether a customer will leave the bank in the near future or not. Historical data about customer behavior and contract terminations with the bank are provided.
