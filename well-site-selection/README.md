# Oil Well Site Selection
## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that helps determine the most profitable region for drilling new oil wells. The model utilizes geological survey data from three regions, including measurements of oil quality and volume reserves in 10,000 oil fields per region. The primary objective is to identify the region with the highest potential profit and analyze potential risks using Bootstrap.

## Data
The dataset includes samples of oil reserves and features for each well in three regions: Region 1, Region 2, and Region 3.

## Approach
* Data Loading and Preparation
* Model Training and Validation
* Calculation of Profit and Risks
