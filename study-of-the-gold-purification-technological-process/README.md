# Machine Learning Model Prototype for "Numbers" Company

## Objective 
Predict the concentration of gold during the gold purification process.

## Description 
A machine learning model is being developed for an industrial company that creates solutions for efficient industrial operations. The model aims to predict the gold recovery rate from gold-bearing ore using data from extraction and purification parameters. This model will optimize production to prevent launching ventures with unprofitable characteristics.

## Libraries
