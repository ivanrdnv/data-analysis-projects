# Taxi Order Forecasting Project

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical taxi order data from airports. It includes features like date and time, the number of taxi orders, and potentially other relevant variables. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Goal
The main objective of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts the number of taxi orders for the upcoming hour. The success criteria for the model is to achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test dataset of no more than 48.

## Model Selection
Three different models are considered for this task: Linear Regression, XGBRegressor, and Prophet. The models are selected based on their suitability for time series forecasting and their performance on the test dataset.
