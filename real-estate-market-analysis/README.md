# Real Estate Market Analysis

This project aims to determine the market value of real estate properties and identify typical characteristics of apartments using data from 'Яндекс.Недвижимость' (a real estate service). The analysis focuses on understanding the relationship between property prices, various parameters, and the distance from the city center.

## Project Overview
The project includes the following key steps:

1. Exploring raw data (loading, general information, and histograms).
2. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, rare values, and data type changes).
3. Adding new columns required for further analysis.
4. Exploratory data analysis.
   * Analysis for the Leningrad region.
   * Analysis for Saint Petersburg.
   * Factors influencing property pricing.
5. Summary and Conclusions.

## Main Findings
1. The total area, living area, and kitchen area were identified as significant factors influencing property prices.
2. Apartments located on the first floor tend to have lower prices compared to other floors.
3. The date of publication did not show a significant impact on property prices.
4. The analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the distance from the city center and property prices, where properties farther from the center generally have lower prices.

## Tools and Techniques Used
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
* Histograms: For data distribution visualization.
* Box Plots: To identify outliers and compare data distributions.
* Scatterplots: To explore relationships between variables.
* Categorization: Grouping data based on distance from the city center.
