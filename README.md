## Projects

* Customer Churn Analysis: The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn from the bank in the near future. I have used exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and factors influencing churn rates and built a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.

* Gold Recovery Optimization: This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict the gold recovery coefficient from gold-bearing ore. I have applied data analysis techniques and mathematical optimization to find the best parameters for the process.

* Real Estate Market Analysis: This project involves analyzing the real estate market to identify factors that affect property prices. I have used data visualization and regression analysis to understand the relationship between property prices, various parameters, and the distance from the city center.

* Taxi Demand Forecasting: In this project, I have built a model that accurately predicts the number of taxi orders for the upcoming hour. The project involves time series analysis and forecasting techniques.

* Well-Site Selection: This project focuses on selecting the best sites for oil wells. I have applied machine learning algorithms to identify the region with the highest potential profit.
